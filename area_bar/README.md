# Creating an Area Bar Chart using the SGPLOT Procedure

This directory contains two files:
- AreaBarDataMacros.sas
- AreaBarExamples.sas

The macros perform all of the data summarizations and the data transformations needed to render the chart using the POLYGON plot
and (optionally) the TEXT plot statements. The examples file shows you how to use the macros, depending on the type of
of area bar chart you want to create.
